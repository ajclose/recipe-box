## Project Description:

Build an application to store recipes. This application should have at least three models: Recipe, Ingredient, and RecipeStep. (You can name these something else.)

Your application will not have authentication. All users should be able to create new recipes, add ingredients and steps to them, and edit recipes, ingredients, and steps.
